# kfc-clone-website
Welcome to the KFC Clone Website project! 🎉

This is a front-end-only website designed to replicate the look and feel of the official KFC website using only HTML and CSS. The project is fully optimized for desktop viewing and aims to deliver a seamless user experience.

🚀 Features
HTML and CSS Only: Built entirely with fundamental web development technologies—no JavaScript or frameworks.
Desktop Optimization: Designed specifically for desktop users, ensuring a clean and responsive layout on larger screens.
Realistic Design: Mimics the design elements of the official KFC website.
🛠️ Future Improvements
This project is a work in progress, and I plan to introduce:

Responsiveness for mobile and tablet devices.
Improved styling for enhanced visual appeal.
Interactive elements using JavaScript.
Additional pages and features.
